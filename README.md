# arkanoid
There is just a prototype of a game "Arkanoid".
Based on "config" file a parser creates an array of objects that are separated on destroyable and not.
A ball moves inside borders and reflects from obstacles. Acheiving demanded amount of collision an obstacle is destroyed.
Instead of using a namespace or a separate config file struct Settings provides variables for setting the project up.
